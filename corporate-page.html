	Justification of design choices. 

 

	Colour scheme 

	The colour scheme has been chosen to create a visually striking interface that balances attention-grabbing elements with readability and warmth. 

Red (9A1C1F):  

This colour evokes a sense of urgency, passion, and energy. It can be attention-grabbing and is often associated with action. 

Black (1B1919) and Gray (574D4E):  

These colours provide a strong contrast against lighter elements and can enhance readability and visual hierarchy. 

Beige (D7CABA):  

Beige tones are warm and comforting, often associated with reliability and neutrality. This colour can create a sense of trust and approachability, 

 

Font Choices (Paytone One, Futura PT Medium, Futura PT Book) 

The font choices aim to create a cohesive visual identity while prioritizing readability and modern aesthetics. By using a combination of bold and lighter weights, the design ensures a harmonious balance between visual impact and legibility. 

 

User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.) 

The use of navigation patterns such as top navigation bar was curtail due to its 

familiarity to users. They already know how to navigate through it which is what makes it more accessible. 

Error messages we used also play a big role because they provide immediate 

feedback. If the user entered the wrong password, the error icon will provide feedback of what needs to be changed in order to move on.  

With grid view, we assure a visually appealing environment, optimise the space  

and consistency. </p>
